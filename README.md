# Share data from Azure Data Explorer using Azure Data Share (Preview)

Welcome to the Preview of Azure Data Share in-place sharing support for Azure Data Explorer (ADX). This article describes how to get started sharing data from ADX. Please follow all pre-requisites outlined in the documentation to successfully share and receive ADX data!

Firstly, please ensure that you have sent us your Azure Subscription ID(s) for the Azure subscriptions you'd like to share data from and to. This is submitted when [signing up for the preview](https://aka.ms/azuredatasharepreviewsignup).

Next, you would have received an e-mail from the Azure Data Share team informing you that your Azure subscription has been enabled for ADX-based sharing. To understand how this feature works, please read [How Azure Data Explorer in-place sharing works](concepts-adx-sharing.md).

To start sharing data from an ADX cluster, ensure that you follow ALL pre-requisites in [Share your ADX data](share-your-adx-data.md).

For a data consumer to receive your data to an ADX cluster, ensure that they follow ALL pre-requisites in [Receive ADX data](receive-adx-data.md).

To troubleshoot data sharing issues, refer to [Troubleshoot common issues](troubleshoot-adx-sharing.md).
